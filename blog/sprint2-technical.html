    </td>
    <td>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. <br>
      Setting the top, bottom, and left properties of a relative-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. <br>
      Other conent will not adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. <br>
    </td>
    <td>
      An element with postion:fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. <br>
      The top, right, bottom and left properties are used to position the element. <br>
      A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. <br>

<h1>Let's Explore Together</h1>

<h3>In the beginning there are 2 retangular boxes and they are good!</h3>
<p>Let's define some HTML structure. If we create 2 retangular boxes, and made them 100px for both height and weight. <br>
Let one of them be position:static with background color lightskyblue, and the other retangular with background color orange but without declare any position. <br>
The orange box will appear on top of the lightskyblue box, just like shown in the picture 1. <br>
<img src="../images/S2T/StaticResult.jpg"><br>
</p>

<h3>Position:Relative</h3>
<p>However, if we give the orange box with position:relative, and 100px from top relative to its old position and 100px from left. <br>
Now we can move the element. The orange box is now moved 100px to bottom & right, relative to its normal position. <br>
<img src="../images/S2T/RelativeResult.jpg"><br>
</p>

<h3>Position:Absolute</h3>
<p>In position:relative, the element is positioned relative to itself. However, an absolute positioned element is relative to its parent. <br>
If you put both of them in a container, div class="container", and both boxes are position:absolute, you will only see one box on top of the other. <br>
<img src="../images/S2T/AbsoluteResult.jpg"><br>
Now, move the orange box 5px to the left and 5 px to the top; you will see start to see a bit of lightskyblue box at the bottom. <br>
<img src="../images/S2T/AbsoluteResult1.jpg"><br>
Since the absolute positioned element are relative to its parent, if you put the container as position:relative and move the orange box right:5px, <br>
5px relative to the most-right of parent. The result will show that lightskyblue box on the top left corner of corner of the container, and the orange box <br>
will be 5px away from the top right position of container. <br>

</p>

<h3>Position:Fixed</h3>
<p>Like position:absolute, fixed positioned elements are also remove from the normal document flow. The real differences are only 2: <br>
</p>
<div>
  <li>They are <strong>only relative to the html document,</strong> not any other parents.</li>
  <li>They are <strong>not affected by scrolling</strong>.</li>
</div>
