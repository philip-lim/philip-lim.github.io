<h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and <br>
your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3> <br>
<p>The 3 new things are:  <br>
<p>
1. Analogy of relate a programmer to a problem solver and a framework for problem solving. <br> 
2. The important of Core learning in programmer journey. <br>
3. There are so much to learn about Arrays and Objects </p> <br>

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<p>It is still the framework for problem solving. As I have learned and practise the 7 steps effective problem solving method before, which I only used it to tackle engineering problem. The framework of problem solving that I learned in the core learning session shares a lot similarity with the '7 steps'. Indeeed it also teaches to start the day as part of the process, which to me is very align with the thinking I have that I learned from Miracle Morning! </p>
<p>I attached the 7 Steps of Effective Problem Solving Method at the end of the reflection for sharing purposes!</p>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
<p>I think to me and a lot of people is to make it into a habits of the way problem solving. I strongly believe that if we practise both core and technical skills as what we have learned in EDA, we will be a great programmer in very near future. It is never to late to start learning something great even if you are in your 60s.</p> <br>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time <br>
focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3> <br>
<p>In my opinion, there are few main reasons behind this: <br>
1. Company hire someone that could fit into their culture and not someone erogant but skillful. <br>
2. I good programmer needs both core and technical skills to succeed in the career. <br>
3. I believed what EDA trying to teach here is a process or a journey to be a good programmer. And the PROCESS is definately more valueable and important than GOAL or result. When you commit to the process — never giving up, creatively overcoming setbacks and obstacles, trying new strategies — a powerful metamorphosis happens. You literally transform in the process. In Rich Dad Poor Dad quote, “The process is testing you as well as teaching you. If you pass the test and learn the lessons, you get to go on to your next process. If you fail a test and quit rather than retake the test, the process spits you out.” -Robert Kiyosaki. It is also important for a student choose TO BECOME a good PROGRAMMER and not just purely RECEIVE the programmer graduation certificate as the ultimate goal. <br></p>
<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? <br> 
Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? <br>
Justify your answer.</h3><br>
<p>Not at all. I am a lifelong learner.</p> <br>

<h2>Seven Ways to Problem Solve</h2> <br>
<h3>Written by: Eva Kovač, Univ. graduate of Psychology</h3> <br>

<p>One logical way to problem solve is to seek support.  While it is logical to seek advice, don't forget that the final decision is still yours to make.</p> <br>

<p>It is typically easier to advise others how to react in a particular problematic situation than to confront that same or similar situation ourselves. This is a main reason individuals seek solutions by consulting others for outside opinions.</p> <br>

<p>Seeking support: It is common to get caught up in a problematic situation where we don't see a possible or clear solution. It is difficult to dissociate and remain neutral while accurately assessing a problem at hand in order to recognize possible solutions. Strong emotional ties make this process especially difficult.</p>

<h3>The final decision is yours:</h3>

<p>Like many of us, you've likely offered advice to a friend which didn't produce optimal results. They maybe said something along the lines of "Why did I listen to you?".</p><br>

<p>People often seek outside advice to remove responsibility from their own shoulders. Taking responsibility for one's own actions and words is the hardest part of making decisions and resolving issues. Doubt and negative thoughts form quickly: "What if I haven't made the right choice?", "What if I don't succeed?", "Am I making the right decision?".</p> <br>

<h1>7 Steps for Effective Problem Solving</h1> <br>
<p>Below are concise descriptions of the 7 steps for effective problem solving.</p> <br>

<p>This problem solving technique is commonly used by psychologists in the counseling process to assist individuals in finding a solution on their own, and put it to use in a real scenario. </p> <br>

<h3>Step 1: Identifying the Problem</h3> <br>
<p>Ask yourself what the problem is. There may be multiple issues within a single situation. Make a list of these issues and define why each one is a problem to you. Focus on behaviors rather than on yourself or a person (Incorrect example: "The problem is that I am stupid.") (Correct example: "The problem is that I easily allow others to betray or disappoint me, because I trust people too quickly.").</p> <br>

<h3>Step 2: Defining Goals</h3> <br>
<p>Try to define your goals specifically, while making them as realistic and attainable as possible. An example of a poor or broad goal is "I want to be happy." First, define what happiness means to you and what you can do to feel happier overall. Try to form your goals in the sense of actions you can take to achieve the desired goal. </p> <br>

<h3>Step 3: Brainstorming</h3>
<p>Take time to brainstorm possible ways to resolve the problem. Do not rush this process- People often want to prevent and solve problems before they even appear. Write down all ideas, even the ones that seem absurd or bizarre. Try to find 6-8 varying alternatives when resolving a particular problem.</p> <br>

<h3>Step 4: Assessing Alternatives</h3> <br>
<p>For every alternative you formed in the previous step, weigh the positive effects and negative consequences that each solution would bring. For every and any option, determine its advantages and its risks.</p> <br>

<h3>Step 5: Choosing the Solution</h3> <br>
<p>Carefully weigh all solutions. The best solution is not necessarily the option with the most pros and/or the least cons. Think about what means more to you, which solution can highlight the positive effects that matter the most to you, and which solution produces the mildest consequences. When you decide on a solution, it is important to create a timeline of when you intend to achieve your ultimate goal. </p>  <br>

<h3>Step 6: Active Execution of the Chosen Solution</h3> <br>
<p>Don't worry about failure. In this phase, concentrate on the journey that will lead you to your goal- don't worry yourself with potential problems.</p> <br>

<h3>Step 7: Evaluation</h3> <br>
<p>It's time to evaluate your success. If you were successful, congratulations! If not, no worries. Maybe you didn't quite choose the right solution or the situation changed. You have definitely learned something. Take this newfound knowledge, return to the beginning steps, and try again!</p> <br>
